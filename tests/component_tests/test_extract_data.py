Integration Component Tests for extract_data() Function

These tests validate the extract_data() function as an integration component,
testing how it coordinates multiple extraction functions to work together.

Test Coverage:
1. Data Integration: Verifies that extract_data() properly coordinates both
   extract_transactions() and extract_customers() functions
2. Data Integrity: Ensures extracted data from both sources matches expected
results exactly
3. Error Propagation: Tests that failures from either extraction function are
properly handled
4. Execution Flow: Validates fail-fast behaviour and function call ordering
5. Data Source Access: Confirms both database and CSV sources are accessed with
compatible data

Integration Component Tests focus on:
- Coordination between multiple components
    (extract_transactions + extract_customers)
- Real data source integration (actual database + CSV file)
- End-to-end data flow validation within the extract phase
- Cross-component error handling and propagation
- Data compatibility between different source types

This differs from individual component tests by:
- Testing multiple components working together
- Validating data relationships between sources
- Ensuring the extract phase works as a cohesive unit
- Using minimal mocking (only for error simulation)

Note: Logging is not tested here as it's considered a cross-cutting concern
best validated at the E2E test level.

"""Component tests for the extract_data function.

This module tests the extract_data function which orchestrates the extraction
of data from multiple sources (database and CSV file). These are component-level
tests that verify the integration between extraction functions while testing
with real data sources.

Test Categories:
- Integration testing: Verifies extract_data correctly combines extraction 
functions
- Error handling: Tests exception propagation from underlying extraction 
functions
- Data validation: Confirms extracted data matches expected structure and 
content
- Source verification: Validates access to both database and CSV data sources

Fixtures:
- expected_transactions: Normalized transaction data from CSV for comparison
- expected_customers: Normalized customer data from CSV for comparison
